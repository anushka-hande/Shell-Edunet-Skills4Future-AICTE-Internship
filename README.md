# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System
Machine learning-based system to recommend optimal crops and fertilizers based on soil and environmental conditions.

## Overview
Part of Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship (January-February 2025).

## Week 1: Data Analysis & EDA
- Analyzed crop recommendation dataset (2200 samples, 22 crops)
- Created visualizations for soil nutrients and environmental conditions
- Identified optimal growing conditions for different crop categories

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11.9
- numpy==2.2.2
- pandas==2.2.3 
- matplotlib==3.10.0
- seaborn==0.13.2

## Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open notebooks in Jupyter/VS Code

## Dataset Features
